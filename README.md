FridgeMagnet
============

Physics based game written in Java

The goal of the game is to get the blue ball from the top left corner to the cup.  Pieces in the bottom of the screen are to be used to help achieve this goal.  Drag the pieces using the Left Mouse Button and rotate (only applies to green piece) using Right Mouse Button.

To run the code, the contents of the res folder must be placed into the folder that contains the .class of the java files.  Alternatively, you can run the .jar file "FridgeMagnet.jar".
